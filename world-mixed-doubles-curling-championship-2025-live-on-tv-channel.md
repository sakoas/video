The pressure is on at the World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, set to begin Saturday at Fredericton‚Äôs Willie O‚ÄôRee Place.

Not only are teams competing for medals, but they‚Äôre also looking to lock up spots for their countries in next year‚Äôs Winter Olympics in Milan/Cortina.

Seven countries will qualify based on the combined results from last year and this year‚Äôs world championships, with host Italy already guaranteed a spot.

Not all hope is lost if teams fall short in Fredericton. The two final spots will be decided at a last-chance Olympic Qualifying Event taking place in December in Kelowna, B.C.

Kadriana Lott and Colton Lott finished fifth for Canada at last year‚Äôs world championship in Sweden. Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant will represent Canada this time around after winning the Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Trials earlier this season. Should Peterman and Gallant help Canada clinch an Olympic berth, the pair will be bound for Milan/Cortina.

Format

The 20-team field is split into two pools of 10 for round-robin play.

Group A consists of Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Scotland, South Korea and Sweden.

Group B consists of Australia, Czechia, Estonia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.

The top three teams from each group advance to the playoffs. The first-place teams receive byes to the semifinals with the second-place and third-place teams crossing over for the qualification games (i.e. A2 vs. B3, B2 vs. A3).

Teams to watch

The 20-team field is stacked, but with only six advancing to the playoffs, some very good squads are going to miss the cut.
