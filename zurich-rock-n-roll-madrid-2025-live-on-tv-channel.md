In 2024, the event reached a record-breaking milestone, welcoming 40,000 runners from 113 countries across its three races. The marathon was won by Ethiopia’s Mitku Tafa (2:08:57) and Kenya’s Naom Jebet (2:26:19). The 47th edition will take place on Sunday, April 27, 2025.

The course is considered one of the most scenic on the international calendar. Starting on the iconic Paseo de la Castellana (near Gregorio Marañón metro station), runners pass by landmarks such as the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the Cuatro Torres Business Area, Puerta del Sol, the Royal Palace, Casa de Campo Park, Madrid Río Park and the Prado Museum—just steps away from the finish line on Paseo de Recoletos, between Plaza de Cibeles and Plaza de Colón.

Almost twenty live rock bands energize runners along the route, while the passionate Madrid crowd—famous for its love of sports—adds the perfect finishing touch to this challenging yet unforgettable race. The city’s rolling terrain makes for anything but a flat course, but that only adds to the epic experience.
