The ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Strongest Fight‚Äù is taking place in Poland and will be Hall‚Äôs first traditional MMA fight. He previously competed in a two-on-one ‚Äúfreak fight‚Äù, where Hall knocked out the Neffati brothers at the end a dreadfully boring encounter.

Things should be very different when he battles Pudzianowski, the Polish former strongman with experience in the octagon.

Their co-main event Heavyweight bout will be Hall‚Äôs biggest test yet. Pudzianowkski knocked out K1 legend Bob Sapp and has even beaten Butterbean, so is on a much higher level than Hall has dealt with before.

Elsewhere on the card, Adrian Bartosi≈Ñski faces off in the main event fight against Andrzej Grzebyk, and there‚Äôs another Heavyweight fight as Artur Szpilka takes on Errol Zimmerman.
