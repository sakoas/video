A late change of personnel will see Chris Camozzi defend his cruiserweight crown at BKFC 73 on Saturday, where Andrea Bicchi is stepping in as a late replacement for the injured Lorenzo Hunt. Bicchi, 28, will be making his BKFC debut in front of a home crowd at the Palazzo Wanny in his native Florence, and the man known as ‚ÄòItalian Thunder‚Äô faces a gargantuan challenge of risk and reward on the big stage. Former UFC contender Camozzi hoped to avenge his sole BKFC loss against Hunt, though he‚Äôll now hope to send off a stacked 12-fight card in style with his first title defense.

Fans are in for a treat when the BKFC cruiserweight championship will be put on the line, and Bicchi could hardly hope to make his BKFC debut in a higher-stakes duel:

Before that, however, BKFC 73 will lay on a smorgasbord of smash with a card steeped in fixtures largely involving fighters of the (much) larger variety. And there‚Äôs a hefty selection of Italian contenders in particular looking to make their mark on home soil, such as light heavyweight Giovanni Carpentieri, goes up against fellow BKFC debutant Josef Hala. Carpentieri, 35, has lost his last three consecutive bare knuckle fights in Bad to the Bone but will hope BKFC gives him the rejuvenation he seeks against Hala, who is 3-0 in the sport.

Venezian talent Enzo Tobbia and Nigeria‚Äôs Michael Igwegbe will also make their BKFC bows against one another in a light heavyweight showdown. As for the more experienced names on the card, BKFC veteran Steve Banks will fight for the second time this year already when he takes on Australian newcomer Haze Hepi at heavyweight. That fracas in particular will be one worth keeping an eye on considering Banks normally tips the scales at 290lbs, while Hepi was around 20lbs lighter for his most recent fight. And while Banks may have the edge in BKFC experience, Hepi has won his last three fights in a row and is undefeated in bare knuckle.
