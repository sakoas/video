Recreating much of the previously popular route, the event will take place on the historic City Centre streets before heading to the nearby countryside and out towards Shakespeare’s county of Warwickshire.

A great event for runners and spectators alike, this scenic route promises to attract huge crowds of supporters and allows for a spot of phenomenal sightseeing as the gothic city centre meets the picturesque countryside.

Not just a route with something for everyone to appreciate, runners embarking upon the Coventry Cathedral finish line will be greeted with a goody bag of rewards, including post-run treats and a hard-earned bespoke medal for them to remember the day.
