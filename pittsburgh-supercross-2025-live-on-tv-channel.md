On Saturday, riders will race the 15th round of the 17-round Monster Energy AMA Supercross (also round 15 of the 31-round 2025 SuperMotocross World Championship) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Supercross returns to the Steel City for the first time since 1983, so you do not want to miss out on the action. We are back onto a typical SX format this weekend, with opening ceremonies taking place at 6:30 p.m. Eastern and racing starting at 7 p.m. Eastern.
