1) The route

From Greenwich Park in south-east London, the athletes head east first towards Woolwich, turn north to the Thames and then along the river‚Äôs southern bank and onwards to the raised-thumb loop at Rotherhithe. They turn east again to cross over the postcard friendly Tower Bridge and east again and into the Isle of Dogs. With legs and limbs growing ever heavier, the competitors head back towards Westminster and Big Ben along the north bank of the Thames and ever onwards to the grand backdrop of Buckingham Palace and the finishing line at the Mall.

With London‚Äôs temperatures forecast to rise into the low 20s, the conditions could prove challenging for many even over a route that is mostly flat. Spare a thought for the costumed competitors: not the ideal weather for those runners dressed as fridges or gorillas.

The 45th running of the London Marathon gets under way in Greenwich on Sunday morning, a diverse multitude of elite athletes, costumed fun-runners, wheelchair competitors, the capital‚Äôs streets thronging with supporters over 26.2 miles, all cheering home the biggest field ‚Äì 56,000 souls ‚Äì to take part in this celebrated event.

Central London‚Äôs traffic may grind to a halt but records will fall, personal landmarks set and colossal sums of money raised for charities. The race is, after all, the world‚Äôs largest annual one-day fundraising event, with more than ¬£1.3bn raised since 1981. And whether you are competing or following the action, here is your guide to the day ‚Ä¶

2) Elite contenders

Among the world‚Äôs leading marathon runners it is hard to ignore Eliud Kipchoge‚Äôs credentials as favourite for the men‚Äôs race, which gets under way at 9.35am (times BST). The first athlete to run a marathon in under two hours (in 2019) and four times a winner (a record), the distance-running eminence returns for the first time since 2020.

Sure to be on his shoulder are the defending champion, Kenya‚Äôs Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and Ethiopia‚Äôs Tamirat Tola, who powered to gold at the Paris Games in an Olympic record of 2hr 6min 26sec. Those seeking an outsider to cheer, look no further than the Ugandan Jacob Kiplimo. The half marathon world record-holder makes his London debut after becoming the first to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes in February.

For the women‚Äôs field, first off at 9.05am, two heroes of Paris 2024 feature in the Olympic champion, Sifan Hassan, and the silver medallist, Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigst Assefa. Hassan won the women‚Äôs race two years ago as she defied an injury to her hip ‚Äì and nearly being taken out by a motorcycle ‚Äì to claim a shock victory. ‚ÄúI was born for drama,‚Äù the Dutch athlete joked after 2023‚Äôs thrilling sprint finish.

The winners will receive ¬£41,000, while a ¬£112,000 bonus is the prize for any man running under 2:02 or woman below 2:15. Some ¬£98,000 extra will be pocketed by any runner setting a world record. (Sidenote: this year‚Äôs race will host 87 official Guinness World Record attempts.)

Contesting the elite wheelchair events is something of a Swiss affair. Marcel Hug is going for a seventh ‚Äì and fifth consecutive ‚Äì London Marathon victory, while his compatriot Catherine Debrunner is targeting a third London victory medal to adorn her mantelpiece alongside five Paralympic golds from Paris 2024. Oh, and they both hold their respective London records: Hug 1:23:44, (2023); Debrunner 1:38:24, (2022).
3) Oldest and youngest

Among the more than 30 octogenarians running will be two travelling from the United States ‚Äì alongside approximately 5,446 Americans taking part ‚Äì laying claim to being the oldest participants in this year‚Äôs race. Hats off to the 84-year-old Mohan Kudchadker and 83-year-old Mary Jo Brinkman for making us couch potatoes feel even more tardy.

As for the youngest participants, Lucy Jones from Hull turns 18 on Sunday and is raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support in memory of her mother, Clare, and grandmother Joan. Likewise, the youngest male participant, Callum Smillie, who celebrated his 18th birthday three days before the race, is running for Cancer Research UK in memory of his grandmother Margaret, who died from cancer.
4) Ever presents

How is this for persistence in the face of adversity? There are six stalwarts who have competed in all 44 London Marathons to date: best of British to Chris Finill (Harrow AC), Michael Pearce (Ranelagh Harriers), Bill O‚ÄôConnor (Queen‚Äôs Park Harriers), Jeff Aston (Les Croupiers RC), David Walker (Chiltern Harriers) and Malcolm Speake (Road Runners AC).
5) Brit watch

Making their London Marathon debuts are Eilish McColgan, the British record holder for 5,000m, 10,000m, 5km, 10km, 10 miles and the half-marathon, and the Olympic and world triathlon champion, Alex Yee. Also among the 46,353 competitors from the UK are the elite athletes Mahamed Mahamed and Philip Sesemann in the men‚Äôs race and Charlotte Purdue, Rose Harvey and Phily Bowden in the women‚Äôs event. Honourable mention too for David Weir. The record eight-time winner is back again for his 26th consecutive appearance in the men‚Äôs wheelchair race.

For those playing sporting celebrity bingo, get ready to tick off the cycling valedictorian Sir Jason Kenny, former England cricket captains and Sirs Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook, plus footballing notables Jack Wilshere, John Terry and Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci ‚Äì all are dusting off their running shoes. From the world of entertainment the presenters Kelly Brook and Chris Evans, singer Alexandra Burke and McFly drummer Harry Judd join the throng.
