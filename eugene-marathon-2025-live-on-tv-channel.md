The Eugene Marathon and Half Marathon courses will start on Agate Street, in the shadow of Hayward Field, heading south. The course takes runners through the University neighborhoods and south on E Amazon all the way to Frank Kinney Park. Heading back toward the University of Oregon, runners follow Amazon Parkway and turn east on 19th Ave. Near Mile 9, runners pass by Hayward Field heading north, cross Franklin Blvd and head east toward Springfield. After joining the Ruth Bascom Riverbank Path System, the Marathon and Half Marathon courses split at Knickerbocker Footbridge. The Half Marathon loops west in Alton Baker Park, crosses the Frohnmayer Footbridge and returns to Hayward Field for a final 200m on the track. See lessd
