The key to the event's success has been it's ability to offer a unique package of experience. The popular sport of long-distance running is transformed for runners and walkers in the dramatic setting of mountains, glacier lakes and a rugged green-brown landscape which winds in and around the challenging mountain wilderness of Galway in the west of Ireland.

The course meanders past bogs, hills, lakes, and the Twelve Pin mountains rising up over the great expanse of Killary Lough, through the quiet village of Leenane, around the Maumturk Mountains and all the way back up to Maam Cross. International participants enjoy the Irish welcome, the sense of comradeship on the lonely route and unmistakable buzz throughout the day. This sporting event sends people away with a taste of Ireland and all its highlights.
