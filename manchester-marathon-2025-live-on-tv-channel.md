More than 35,000 runners are expected to take part in this weekend's Manchester Marathon. Organisers are expecting entrants from all over the world to pound the city's streets for the annual race on Sunday, which this year has a new finish line outside the University of Manchester on Oxford Road.

Runners and spectators have been urged to plan their journeys well in advance because the main roads around Trafford will be closed for much of the day.

Many buses will be diverted, while transport bosses also expect Metrolink services to be very busy.

The course, which loops around South Manchester, starts by Old Trafford football stadium before turning back on to Chester Road towards Sale, and then arriving in Altrincham.

Runners will then turn back, passing through Baguley and back through Sale, before passing Chorlton, Whalley and Hulme.

The finishing line this year has been moved to Oxford Road. 

The first batch of runners, which includes the elite athletes expected to battle it out for a podium finish, will set off at 09:00 BST.

Groups will then be released at 10-minute intervals until the last cohort sets off at 11:30.

Last year's winner Adam Clarke completed the 26.2 miles (42.2km) in two hours, 15 minutes and 35 seconds.

Organisers said all roads are due to reopen by 19:00, with many becoming accessible sooner.
